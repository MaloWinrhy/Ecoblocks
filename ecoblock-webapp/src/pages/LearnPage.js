          <p>This documentation describes the relevant components, modules, and features that constitute the EcoBlocks Network.</p>
          <p>EcoBlocks connects the physical world to Web3 by using smartphones as edge nodes. The edge nodes read devices and sensors in the physical world using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and connect that information to the blockchain. Anyone with a smartphone can join the network and earn ECOB, EcoBlocksâ€™s native token.</p>
